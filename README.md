**SLIGHTLY VOLATILE**

Small package for decrypting PGP-encrypted email.

-   Works with Facebook PGP, OS X GPGTools, and command line GnuPG
-   Encryption using PGP public keys
-   Keybase integration with tracked users to allow for easy selection for users

**Incomplete** spec tests are available for this package at the moment. I have not fully
designed them yet.

**Do not** trust the security of this package. It is not audited, fully tested,
or safe at all.

## TODO
